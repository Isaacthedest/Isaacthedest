# Pricing and Stock

## How it works

When purchasing or selling items, it changes the amount in stock and how much it costs. The more items in stock by selling, the less it cost and the less items in stock by buying, the higher the price. Also when an item can only be bought and not sold, it has a limited stock which can run out. The only way for items that can't be sold to the store to restock, is a monthly restock.

Most items can run out of stock and can only be refilled every month
